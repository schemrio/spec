Schemr is a modern flexible general purpose modeling language built for
the modern Web App. Schemer uses Bleeding-Edge Enterprise Scalability,
running on a Persistent, Isolated ÂµService-based Stack, and incorporates an Automated
Service System that helps you detect unnecessary bloating and relieves pressure on
code maintainers.

With this bleeding-edge design innovation used daily by Fortune 500 companies
baked in, Schemr can make designing everything from monolithic software stacks to
real time critical microservices easy as pi. Built from the ground up to be a modular,
yet minimal and simplistic framework, Schemr can get you up and running in no time.

Built to avoid both the most common and rare problems with App Prototyping,
Schemr can integrate easily with your team's design process, and can often provide
valuable insight to avoid code bloat and logical bugs, even helping you detect
future problems before they happen.
