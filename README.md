Schemr is a modern flexible general purpose modeling language built for
the modern Web App. With an Isolation Oriented Architecture paired with

Schemr can make designing everything from monolithic software stacks to real time
critical microservices easy as pi. Built from the ground up to be a modular, yet
minimal and simplistic framework, Schemr can get you up and running in no time.

Schemr can integrate easily with your team's design process, and can often provide
valuable insight to avoid code bloat and logical bugs.
